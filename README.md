# shopapi

Shopapi project contains api for adding shops to the memory,getting nearest shop based on customer's lattitude and longitude.

Whenever a shop is added the service calls the Google Maps API. The Google Maps API responds
with the longitude and latitude, which allows the shop data to be updates with longitude and latitude.
A customer, using their geolocation on their phone, wants to find the store that is closest to them.
The Shops API will have the customerâ€™s longitude and latitude, but also the longitude and latitude of
each shop to do the calculation.
The customer does a RESTful GET to the Shops API, providing their current longitude and latitude
(e.g. URL request params), and gets back the address, longitude and latitude of the shop nearest to
them.
